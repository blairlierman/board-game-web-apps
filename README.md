# Board Game Web Apps

This is an Nx monorepo for the collection of Angular-based Web Apps to support various Board and Card Games that I enjoy.

## Apps
### Farming Game Remote Host (farming-game-remote-host)
You want to play the Farming Game via video chat? This app will let you do that.

### SolForge Fusion Health Tracker (sff-tracker)
Designed for the new SolForge Fusion card game to track the health of you and an opponents seated across from each other. (Can also be used for games like Magic: The Gathering)

## Development server

Run `nx serve <project-name>` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `nx build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](http://www.cypress.io/).

## Further help

To get more help on the CLI use `nx help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
